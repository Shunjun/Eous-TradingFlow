# Lightweight Charts Line Tools Core

This package is the central core orchestrator for individual drawing tools built for [Lightweight Charts v5+](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts) plugin system. It is designed as a modern, high-performance **drop-in replacement** for the legacy [v3.8 Line Tools Build](https://github.com/difurious/lightweight-charts-line-tools). This and all the line tools are converted from the 3.8 build via **Vibe Coding** and painstakingly tested by me to ensure it's not AI slop. I am going to use this in my custom trading tool I built. I have been using the 3.8 build for years, its time to go to lightweight v5 and here it is.

The Core handles the "Hard Math" and "UI Logic"—including coordinate interpolation, infinite line clipping, selection states, drag-and-drop anchors, and axis label stacking—allowing individual drawing tools to remain modular, lightweight, and easy to maintain.

## 🧩 Modular & Community Driven

The core is designed to be a flexible foundation. While a standard set of line tool plugins is provided, this architecture is intended to empower developers to build their own custom tools using the core's orchestration capabilities. Improvements to the core logic, or the line tools are always welcome.

**Note:** I am not taking requests for new specific tool types. The purpose of this core orchestrator is to facilitate the community in creating and maintaining their own unique line tools that utilize the core. The intent is for anyone to make a new tool and share it with the community for all to use.

## 🛠 Building the Core

To build the core orchestrator from source, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build
```

## 📂 Output Targets

- **`/dist` — Production Bundles**
  Contains the production-ready builds of the orchestrator. This includes **ESM** (for modern bundlers like Vite or Webpack) and **UMD** formats (for direct browser `<script>` usage). Both development and minified (`.min.js`) versions are provided, including full sourcemaps for debugging.

- **`/docs` — Technical Documentation**
  A full static documentation site generated automatically via **TypeDoc**. By opening `docs/index.html` in any browser, you can explore an exhaustive, extensively notated reference of the entire Core library. Every class, interface, internal utility, and public method is documented directly from the source code to provide a clear roadmap for developers.

## 📦 The Plugin Ecosystem

**<span style="color:red">IMPORTANT</span>:** The Core package is strictly an orchestrator; it does **<span style="color:red">NOT include any line tools by default. To use any drawing functionality, you must install the specific tool plugins you require and register them with the Core instance.</span>** This modular approach allows you to keep your application footprint as small as possible by only including the logic for the tools you actually use.

Below are the official companion packages and the string keys used to invoke them via `addLineTool`:

## 🐛 Known Bugs

The following issues are known, feel free to work on their fix

- ❌ **Mouse Pointer Transitions:** Cursor styles may not always update immediately when moving between different hit-test regions of a tool (e.g., moving from a line border to a resize anchor). It's cosmetic and does not affect functionality

- ❌ **Text Alignment Perception:** The `text.alignment` property (internal text alignment) can be subtle and difficult to notice depending on the box dimensions.
  - **Recommendation:** Use `text.box.alignment` instead. This property controls the alignment of the entire box relative to the anchor point and is the intended method for primary positioning.

## 🚀 Basic Integration

To enable drawing, you need both the core and the specific tool plugins you intend to use.

## 1. Example Install

```bash
npm install github:difurious/lightweight-charts-line-tools-core github:difurious/lightweight-charts-line-tools-rectangle lightweight-charts
```

```typescript
import { createChart, CandlestickSeries } from 'lightweight-charts'
import { createLineToolsPlugin } from 'lightweight-charts-line-tools-core'
import { LineToolRectangle } from 'lightweight-charts-line-tools-rectangle'

const chart = createChart(document.getElementById('chart-container'))

// Lightweight Charts v5 way to add a series
const series = chart.addSeries(
  CandlestickSeries,
  {
    // optional series options
  },
  0,
) //0 at the end is what pane you want the series to belong to

// Initialize the Core Orchestrator
const lineTools = createLineToolsPlugin(chart, series)

// Register the specific tool classes you have installed
lineTools.registerLineTool('Rectangle', LineToolRectangle)

// Start interactive drawing mode (user clicks to place points)
lineTools.addLineTool('Rectangle')
```

# The Test App

### 🧪 Testing & Validation

For developers and contributors, I provide a dedicated **[React Test Application](https://github.com/difurious/lightweight-charts-line-tools-plugin-test-app)**.

This app is used to verify the integrity of the Core and all 12 plugins (21 line tools). It features an **Automated Test Surface Generator** that produces massive grids of tools to validate every style property, culling edge-case, and coordinate interpolation variant in a single view. Turn on the subscriptions and double click any tool you see to get its properties - options to understand what options do what. This is also a visual way to confirm all aspects of the tool are working properly.

## ✨ Core Features & Capabilities

The core orchestrator is built to handle the heavy lifting of chart interactions, allowing you to focus on the visual logic of your tools. Here is what the Core brings to your chart:

### 🖱️ Advanced Interaction & UX

- **Hybrid Drawing Modes:** Seamlessly switch between **Interactive Mode** (click-to-draw with real-time ghosting) and **Programmatic Mode** (instant rendering via API). You can have code update or change the line tool in real time if necessary.
- **Intelligent Interaction Manager:** Automatic handling of hover detection, selection states, and high-performance drag-and-drop logic for tool bodies and anchors.
- **Shift-Key Constraints:** Built-in support for geometric locking, such as forcing horizontal lines (TrendLine).
- **Virtual Anchor Support:** Capability to manage "Virtual Handles"—resize points that don't exist in your data but allow complex manipulation (e.g., the 8-handle grid of a Rectangle or the mid-line handles of a Parallel Channel).
- **Smart Cursors:** Dynamic mouse pointer cursor management that changes based on tool orientation, resize direction (NWSE vs. NESW), or "not-allowed" states for non-editable tools.

### 💾 Data Integrity & Persistence

- **Full State Serialization:** Export the entire visual state of your chart to a clean, valid JSON string for database storage or local persistence.
- **Non-Destructive Import:** Re-hydrate saved tools instantly. The core intelligently updates existing tools by ID while creating new ones, preventing data loss.
- **V3.8 Event Parity:** Fully compatible event delegates for `AfterEdit` (perfect for auto-saving to backends) and `DoubleClick` (ideal for triggering your own way to modify the tools options via your custom UI since on double-click, it passes that tool options in the event.).
- **Precise Point Mapping:** Methods to retrieve, update, or delete tools using unique IDs or flexible Regular Expressions for bulk cleanup.

### 📐 Geometric & Mathematical Power

- **"Blank Space" Interpolation:** logic allows tools to be drawn and tracked in the "past or future" — the empty space to the right or left of the current data bars where no chart data exists.
- **Unbounded Point Handling:** Support for tools with a fixed point count (e.g., 1, 2, 3+) (Rectangle/TrendLine/Triangle) or variable, "infinite" point arrays (drawing) (Brush/Path/Highlighter).
- **Infinite Line Clipping:** Advanced parametric math to handle Rays and Extended Lines. If the tool is actually off screen and no part of it (including extensions) can be seen, it does not render the tool. It does the cull check for each tool individually.

### 🚀 High-Performance Rendering

- **Multi-Stage Culling Engine:** When deciding to cull (not draw), it uses dual-layer visibility checking using AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) for shapes and Sub-Segment intersection tests for complex polylines. The sub-segments are used to optimize what is checked for infinite extensions if it is seen on screen or not.
- **Price Axis Label Stacking:** A dedicated manager that detects Y-axis label collisions and shifts them vertically in real-time, ensuring every price label level remains readable.
- **Composite Renderer Architecture:** Ability to stack multiple renderers (Lines, Polygons, Rectangles, and Text) within a single tool to create complex visualizations.
- **Total Customization Overrides:** Flexibility to completely override Core logic for specialized tools, enabling the tool full control of the logic to make your tool work how you want.

### 🛠 Developer Extensibility

- **Modular "Plugin" Design:** The core is strictly an orchestrator. You are encouraged to utilize the `BaseLineTool` and generic renderers to build your own 13th, 14th, or 100th line tool (make sure to share your line tool creations).
- **Bespoke Hit-Testing:** Granular control over hit-test areas, allowing you to prioritize specific parts of a tool (like a border, text box, or background fill) for user to click and edit the tool.

# 📖 Public API Reference

The following methods are implemented by the Core and are accessible via the plugin instance. These are the methods that a front end user would utilize.

## Data Fetching API (OHLC & Time)

#### `getDataInRange({ from, to })`

Retrieves all native series data objects (OHLC) found within the requested range.

- _Example:_ `const bars = plugin.getDataInRange({ from: 1672531200, to: 1672617600 });`

#### `getBarAtTime(time)`

Retrieves a single data row at a specific timestamp. Returns `null` if no exact match is found.

#### `getClosestBar(time, mode)`

Finds the data row closest to a target timestamp based on a specific search strategy:

- **'exact'**: Returns data only if the timestamp matches perfectly.
- **'floor'**: Returns the nearest bar at or **before** the target time. (Essential for cross-timeframe syncing, e.g., finding a 15m candle from a 1m timestamp).
- **'ceil'**: Returns the nearest bar at or **after** the target time.
- **'nearest'**: Returns the absolute closest bar in either direction.

#### `getBarAtCoordinate(x)`

Retrieves the data row located at a specific pixel X-coordinate on the chart.

#### `getEarliestBar()` / `getLatestBar()`

Ultra-fast lookups to retrieve the first or last bar currently loaded in the series. These are **Instant Lookups** (Constant-speed), meaning they find the data immediately without searching through the entire dataset.

#### `getFullTimeRange()`

Returns an object `{ from, to }` representing the total time range covered by the loaded data.

## Tool Registration & Creation

#### `registerLineTool(type, toolClass)`

Maps a tool identifier string to its implementation class. Must be called before adding a tool.

#### `addLineTool(type, points?, options?)`

The primary entry point for adding tools.

- **Interactive Mode:** Pass `[]` for `points` to allow the user to click on the chart to place points.
- **Programmatic Mode:** Pass an array of `LineToolPoint` objects to create the tool at specific coordinates.

#### `createOrUpdateLineTool(type, points, options, id)`

Creates a new tool with a specific ID, or updates it if that ID already exists. Primarily used for state synchronization.

#### `applyLineToolOptions(toolData)`

Perform a partial update on an existing tool's options or points using its `id`.

## Retrieval & Selection

#### `getSelectedLineTools()`

Returns a JSON string of all tools currently selected by the user.

#### `getLineToolByID(id)`

Retrieves the data for a specific tool by its unique ID (returned as a JSON string).

#### `getLineToolsByIdRegex(regex)`

Retrieves a list of tools whose IDs match a specific Regular Expression.

## Global Settings & Control

#### `setMagnetThreshold(pixels)`

Sets the snapping tolerance for the crosshair and tool anchors. Set to `0` to disable. Holding shift on shift enabled line tools disables snapping and will be constrained to the appropriate price the shift logic chooses.

- _Example:_ `plugin.setMagnetThreshold(10);` // Snaps when within 10 pixels of OHLC.

#### `setTimeFormatter(formatter)`

Configures a custom formatter for time axis labels. The core uses a **Tiered Priority**:

1. **User Formatter:** (Provided here)
2. **Chart Localization:** (`localization.timeFormatter` in chart options)
3. **Scale Fallback:** (Internal scale behavior defaults)

#### `setLocked(locked)`

Sets the global interaction lock. When `true`, existing tools cannot be moved/deleted and new tools cannot be drawn.

#### `isLocked()`

Returns `true` if drawings are currently in read-only mode.

## Removal & Cleanup

#### `removeLineToolsById(ids[])`

Removes one or more tools by their unique string IDs.

#### `removeLineToolsByIdRegex(regex)`

Removes all tools whose IDs match the provided Regular Expression.

#### `removeSelectedLineTools()`

Removes the currently selected line tool(s). "Delete" key is not supported, you can tie this method to a button press.

#### `removeAllLineTools()`

Clears every single line tool managed by the plugin from the chart, and wipes any trace of it.

#### `destroy()`

**The Master Kill Switch.** Completely uninstalls the plugin, kills all global event listeners, and hotswaps all methods with dummies to prevent memory leaks. Use this when unmounting your chart component.

## State Persistence

#### `exportLineTools()`

Serializes the state of all current tools into a JSON string. Perfect for saving chart layouts to a database.

#### `importLineTools(json)`

Imports a set of line tools from a JSON string. This is non-destructive; it updates existing IDs and creates new ones. You could export, save it, remove all, then recall the saved export and then import it.

### Event Subscriptions

#### `subscribeLineToolsAfterEdit(handler)` / `unsubscribeLineToolsAfterEdit(handler)`

Fires when a line tool is modified, moved, or finished being created. This is the recommended hook for triggering an "Auto-Save" to your backend.

#### `subscribeLineToolsDoubleClick(handler)` / `unsubscribeLineToolsDoubleClick(handler)`

Fires when a user double-clicks an existing tool. Often used to open a custom "Properties" or "Settings" modal.

#### `subscribeLineToolsSingleClick(handler)` / `unsubscribeLineToolsSingleClick(handler)`

Fires when a tool is selected or when the current selection is cleared.

## Manual Crosshair Control

#### `setCrossHairXY(x, y, visible, providedTime?, providedPrice?)`

Programmatically positions the chart crosshair. The Core can either convert screen pixels to data or use provided logical values for direct placement.

- **`x`, `y`**: The screen pixel coordinates relative to the chart container.
- **`visible`**: Controls the visibility of the crosshair.
- **`providedTime`**: (Optional) The logical time value (timestamp or date string).
- **`providedPrice`**: (Optional) The logical numerical price value.

Note on Synchronization: Providing both providedTime and providedPrice triggers a Direct Sync Bypass. This ignores internal pixel-to-price estimation and magnet snapping, placing the crosshair exactly on the data coordinates. This is the most efficient method for syncing "slave" charts to a "master" chart to ensure zero jitter and perfect alignment.

#### `clearCrossHair()`

Clears the chart's crosshair, making it invisible.

## 🖼️ Multi-Pane Setup

To support multiple panes, you must create a separate Core Plugin instance for each series. This ensures that coordinate math, height clamping, and "Drawing Silos" are handled correctly for each specific area of the chart.

```typescript
import { createChart, CandlestickSeries, LineSeries } from 'lightweight-charts'
import { createLineToolsPlugin } from 'lightweight-charts-line-tools-core'
import { LineToolRectangle } from 'lightweight-charts-line-tools-rectangle'

const chart = createChart(document.getElementById('chart-container'), {
  // ... chart options
})

// 1. Create the Main Price Series (Pane 0 by default)
const mainSeries = chart.addSeries(
  CandlestickSeries,
  {
    //options
  },
  0,
) // 0 is Pane index

// 2. Create an Indicator Series in a New Pane (Pane 1)
const rsiSeries = chart.addSeries(
  LineSeries,
  {
    title: 'RSI',
    //more options
  },
  1,
) // 1 is Pane index

// 3. Initialize a Core Orchestrator for each Series
// Each instance will independently manage the drawings for its own pane.
const lineToolsMain = createLineToolsPlugin(chart, mainSeries)
const lineToolsRSI = createLineToolsPlugin(chart, rsiSeries)

// 4. Register tools for both instances
lineToolsMain.registerLineTool('Rectangle', LineToolRectangle)
lineToolsRSI.registerLineTool('Rectangle', LineToolRectangle)

// 5. Usage
// This rectangle is mathematically trapped in the Main Pane (Pane 0)
lineToolsMain.addLineTool('Rectangle')

// This rectangle is mathematically trapped in the RSI Pane (Pane 1)
lineToolsRSI.addLineTool('Rectangle')
```

## 🏗 Architectural Deep Dive

### 3-Zone Interpolation Engine

The Core uses a high-precision 3-Zone engine to map screen pixels to logical time and price. This ensures drawings remain perfectly pinned regardless of zoom or timeframe changes.

- **Zone 1: Native History (The Truth):** Snaps coordinates to the exact timestamp of existing data bars.
- **Zone 2: Fractional History (Timeframe Immunity):** If you draw between bars (e.g., on a 1-hour chart), the Core interpolates the fractional position. This allows a tool drawn on a 1-minute timeframe to maintain its exact visual proportions when viewed on a Daily chart, even if it sits "inside" a single daily candle.
- **Zone 3: Verified Blank Space (Future/Past):** When drawing in the empty space where no data exists, the Core performs a **10-Bar Verification**. It probes the last 10 candles to "prove" the chart's true time interval, allowing it to project coordinates forward while gracefully gliding over weekend gaps and overnight halts.

### Culling Engine (AABB & Sub-Segments)

The Core implements an advanced culling engine. It uses Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) tests for simple shapes and robust line-segment intersection tests for infinite lines (Rays, Extended Lines), ensuring only visible primitives are rendered on screen.

### Price Axis Label Stacking

The `PriceAxisLabelStackingManager` monitors all active price labels. When labels from multiple tools collide on the Y-axis, it calculates a vertical shift to stack them cleanly, preventing unreadable overlaps while maintaining visual alignment with their source prices.

### Interaction Manager

A centralized event-bus that manages global DOM listeners. It handles selection logic, drag-thresholds (preventing accidental moves), and the enforcement of Shift-key geometric constraints (like axis-locking).

### Multi-Pane Isolation & Silos

The Core is built for complex multi-pane layouts (e.g., Main Price Pane + RSI Pane + MACD Pane).

- **Drawing Silos:** By initializing a specific Core instance for each series, you create "Silos." A rectangle drawn in the RSI pane is mathematically trapped there; it cannot bleed into the Main Price pane.
- **Coordinate Normalization:** The Core automatically detects the Y-axis offset and height of the specific pane it lives in. It handles all the complex math to translate global mouse coordinates into pane-local prices, including boundary clamping to prevent tools from "jumping" panes during a drag.

### Global Event Hijacking (Capturing Phase)

To ensure a smooth UX, the Interaction Manager utilizes the **DOM Capturing Phase** (`true` flag) for mouse events. This allows the plugin to intercept clicks and drags _before_ other chart UI elements or indicator widgets can swallow the event, making the drawing tools feel responsive even on crowded charts.

### Destroyable Lifecycle

The `destroy()` method implements a "Self-Removal" sequence. Beyond just clearing lines, it:

1.  **Kills Zombie Listeners:** Unbinds all global window/DOM listeners using stable references.
2.  **Hotswaps API:** Overwrites its own public methods with no-op dummy functions. This prevents "Cannot read property of null" crashes if external code (like a React `useEffect` cleanup) tries to call the plugin after it's gone.
3.  **Aggressive Memory Reclaim:** Severs all internal links to the Lightweight Charts API to ensure the browser's Garbage Collector can immediately reclaim 100% of the plugin's RAM.
